# Welcome to the Hypernode-API (beta)
First of, lets's be clear and mention that this API is still in beta and subject to change. So for now it's important 
to not let any of your critical systems depend on this API.

## Authentication
To authenticate at the Hypernode-API you have to make use of the Hypernode-API token provisioned on your node. The 
location for this token is:
 ```
 /etc/hypernode/hypernode_api_token
 ```
You can use the value in this file to make requests
to `https://api.hypernode.com` by specifying the token in the `Authorization` header like so:
```bash
curl https://api.hypernode.com/v1/app/<your_app_name>/ -X GET --header "Authorization: Token <your_hypernode_api_token>"
```
The API will return a 403 if you do not have permission to call a specified endpoint. If you do not authenticate the API
will return a 401 response. If you encounter a 403 and would like to have access to the specified endpoint please feel 
free to contact our support department at support@hypernode.com.
